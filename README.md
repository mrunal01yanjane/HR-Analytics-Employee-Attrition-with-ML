# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-with-ML

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model for employee attrition to help the HR department identify and retain valuable employees. We used an internal HR dataset of employee records, including features such as job role, education, performance retingd, and demographic information.

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed that job satisfaction, work-life balance, and opportunities for career advancement were significant factors influencing employee attrition.

Various models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, adaptive boosting and extreme gradient boosting, were evaluated.
